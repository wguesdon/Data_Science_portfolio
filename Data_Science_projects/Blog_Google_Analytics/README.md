# Analyze BrainPoste Blog traffic

This project was proposed by from the [Data Scientist Syndicate](https://cheekyscientist.com/career-programs/data-scientist-syndicate/) facebook group.

## About BrainPost

Kasey Hemington runs BrainPost with a fellow PhD friend, Leigh Christopher as a way to keep in touch with her scientific roots while working as a data scientist! Every Tuesday since we started in early 2018, we publish our e-newsletter which is three short summaries of new neuroscience studies that have just come out. After publishing on our website each Tuesday, we typically post on Twitter (@brainpostco) and Facebook (@brainpostco) once to announce the release of the e-newsletter and three times (once for each of the three summaries) to highlight each summary. There are a few exceptions to our publishing schedule. Sometimes we post extra articles [here](https://www.brainpost.co/brainpost-life-hacks), and also a few weeks we've only been able to publish two summaries instead of three. At around the same time as we publish the e-newsletter on the website each Tuesday, we also send it to our ~1700 email subscribers directly (via mailchimp).

## The questions to investigate

* What content (or types of content) is most popular (what are patterns we see in popular content) and is different content popular amongst different subgroups (e.g. by source/medium)?

* Where are people visiting from (source-wise)?

## Method

The analysis was performed using python and Google Colaboratory notebooks.
