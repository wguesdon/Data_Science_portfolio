# FSA Hackathon: young population survey analysis

## Introduction

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) is an independent government department working across England, Wales and Northern Ireland to protect public health and consumersâ€™ broader interest in food. The FSA is responsible for making sure food is safe and what it says it is.
On Sat, November 23, 2019, FSA and Pivigo organized a [Hackathon](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/food-standards-agency-data-science-hackathon-tickets-77135950705?utm_source=eventbrite&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=reminder_attendees_48hour_email&utm_term=eventname&ref=eemaileventremind#) to analyze food survey questionnaires.

## Methods

I analyzed the surveys for the young and general populations using R. I performed data cleaning and wrangling using dplyr and data visualization using ggplot2.

## Results

1.  The young population survey didn't have general health and wellbeing assessment preventing clear exploration of the hypothesis.
2.  No apparent effect of food disorder on general health and wellbeing in the young population.
